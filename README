This project utilizes the open-source Tesseract library on iOS to perform OCR on business cards and use the data 
to create new contacts in the iPhone address book. The Tesseract library is compliled as as static library using the 
build script found at:
http://robertcarlsen.net/2010/09/24/compiling-tesseract-v3-for-iphone-1299

The Tesseract source code is available at:
http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/

To rebuild the Tesseract library run tesseract-ocr/build_fat.sh and the libraries will be in tesseract-ocr/outdir. 
This is not required as compiled versions of the libraries have already been included.
